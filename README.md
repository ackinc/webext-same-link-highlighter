Most good documentation sites have a lot of internal linking, where each references several other pages on the site. This helps with navigation, but can make the amount of content seem endless and overwhelming.

This extension helps dispel that illusion slightly - when you hover over a link, it highlights other links on the page that point to the same destination. I've found it useful when creating mental maps of the documentation.
